Memory:

Memory devices are digital systems that store data either temporarily or for a long term.
Digital computers to hard disks have built-in memory devices that can store the data of users or manufacturers.
The data either be in the form of control programs or programs that boot the system. 
Hence, to store such a huge amount of data the memory devices must have enormous capacity.
The challenge is to build memory devices that have large capacities but are cost-effective. 
The memory devices must be capable of storing both permanent data and instantaneous data.

Memories are made up of registers. Each register in the memory is one storage location. 
The storage location is also called a memory location. Memory locations are identified using Address

 

A memory unit consists of data lines, address selection lines, and control lines that 
specify the direction of transfer.

Memory units:

Units of Memory
Memory units are used to measure the size and represent data. Some of the commonly used 
memory units are:

1. Bit
The first memory location in a computer is bit. The smallest measurement unit for 
data held in primary memory and storage devices is a bit. Out of the binary values 
0 and 1, a bit can only have one.

The smallest measurement unit for data in primary memory and storage devices.
Represents binary values 0 and 1.
2. Nibble
It means the group of 4 bits. 
3. Word
It is a fixed number of bits, it is different from computer to computer, but the same 
for each device. Compute store information in the form of words. 

A fixed number of bits that varies across computers but remains consistent within each device.
Used to store information in computers.
4. Bytes
The fundamental unit used to measure data is the byte. It has 8 bits in it. A byte can
therefore represent 2 * 8 or 256 values. They determine the size of files, documents, photos, 
and other kinds of data.

Unimaginable amounts of data, such as
the equivalent of storing all of the material on the internet numerous times or tracking vast amounts, may be 
stored in yottabytes.

File Sizes: When you download a file from the internet, its size is often specified in units like kilobytes (KB), 
megabytes (MB), or gigabytes (GB). 
For example, a music album might be 100 MB in size.

Types of Computer Memory

Cache memory. This temporary storage area, known as a cache, is more readily available to the processor 
than the computer’s main memory source. It is also called CPU memory because it is typically integrated 
directly into the CPU chip or placed on a separate chip with a bus interconnect with the CPU.

RAM.  It is one of the parts of the Main memory, also famously known as Read Write Memory. Random Access memory 
is present on the motherboard and the computer’s data is temporarily stored in RAM. As the name says, 
RAM can help in both Read and write.

D RAM (Dynamic RAM): D RAM uses capacitors and transistors and stores the data as a charge on the
capacitors. They contain thousands of memory cells. It needs refreshing of charge on capacitor after
a few milliseconds. This memory is slower than S RAM.

S RAM (Static RAM): S RAM uses transistors and the circuits of this memory are capable of retaining their
state as long as the power is applied. This memory consists of the number of flip flops with each flip flop
storing 1 bit. It has less access time and hence, it is faster.

ROM: ROM full form is Read Only Memory. ROM is a non volatile memory and it is used to store important 
information which is used to operate the system. We can only read the programs and data stored on it 
and can not modify of delete it.

MROM(Masked ROM): Hard-wired devices with a pre-programmed collection of data or instructions were the 
first ROMs. Masked ROMs are a type of low-cost ROM that works in this way.

PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory): This read-only memory is modifiable once by the user. The user 
purchases a blank PROM and uses a PROM program to put the required contents into the PROM. Its content 
can’t be erased once written.

EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory): EPROM is an extension to PROM where you can erase the 
content of ROM by exposing it to Ultraviolet rays for nearly 40 minutes.

EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory): Here the written contents can be erased 
electrically. You can delete and reprogramme EEPROM up to 10,000 times. Erasing and programming take 
very little time, i.e., nearly  4 -10 ms(milliseconds). Any area in an EEPROM can be wiped and programmed 
selectively.

Virtual memory. A memory management technique where secondary memory can be used as if it were a part 
of the main memory. Virtual memory uses hardware and software to enable a computer to compensate for
physical memory shortages by temporarily transferring data from RAM to disk storage.

Memory Organizing:

• Memory is organized into groups of n bits known as words, Where n is the word length.

• Modern computers typically have word lengths ranging from 16 To 64 bits.

• A 32-bit word can store a 32-bit signed number or four ASCII- encoded characters, each occupying 8 bits 

Memory Address:
A memory address is a unique identifier that points to a specific location in a computer’s memory. 
It’s like a street address that tells you where a particular house is located in a city. In computing,
memory addresses are used to locate and access data stored in memory.
Each byte of memory in a computer has its own unique address. These addresses are typically represented 
in hexadecimal or binary notation. For example, in a 32-bit system, memory addresses might range from 
0x00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF.
Programs use memory addresses to read data from or write data to specific locations in memory. 
This allows them to manipulate variables, arrays, objects, and other data structures effectively. 
Understanding memory addresses is crucial for tasks such as memory management, pointer manipulation, 
and low-level programming.

Big endian and little endian addressing:

Big Endian: In big endian format, the most significant byte (the byte with the highest value) of a
multi-byte data type is stored at the lowest memory address, while the least significant byte is 
stored at the highest memory address. It’s like writing numbers from left to right, with the most 
significant digit on the left. 

Little Endian: In little endian format, the least significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address
, and the most significant byte is stored at the highest memory address. It’s like writing numbers from 
right to left, with the least significant digit on the left.

For example, IBM mainframes and Motorola processors typically use big endian, while x86 and ARM processors commonly 
use little endian. Interoperability between systems with different endianness can require conversion routines.

Memory operations:

Memory operations encompass a variety of tasks related to manipulating data stored in a computer’s memory. 
Here are some common memory operations:

1. Read: This operation involves retrieving data from a specific memory location and transferring 
it to a processor
register or another location in memory.
2. Write: Writing to memory involves storing data from a processor register or another memory location 
into a 
specific memory address.
3. Allocate: Allocating memory involves reserving a block of memory for storing data. This is commonly done dynamically 
during program execution using functions like malloc() in C or new operator in languages like C++ and Java.
4. Free: Freeing memory deallocates previously allocated memory, making it available for other uses. This is important 
to prevent memory leaks and manage memory efficiently.
5. Copy: Copying data from one memory location to another involves reading data from one location and writing it to 
another.
6. Move: Moving data involves transferring data from one memory location to another while potentially modifying 
its original location.
7. Compare: Comparing memory involves examining the contents of two memory locations to determine if they are equal
, greater than, 
or less than each other.
In this example, memory operations are essential for managing the contacts data efficiently and ensuring that the 
user
interface remains
